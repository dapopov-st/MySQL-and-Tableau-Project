The projects and exercises here are done from the perspective of a data analyst at an early-stage eCommerce startup.  The analyst works with the marketing team to analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.  
<br/> The projects are part of the Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence course.

<br/>The analyst first helps the company prepare data for an executive board meeting (see the materials for the midterm project).

<br/>Later, the analyst relates Maven's growth story to potential investors (see the final project).  I have supplemented the SQL analyses with a Tableau story and a chart (also found in Final Project Tableau Analysis.pdf)
<br>i.) Growth Story: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/MySQLTableauMavenFuzzyFactoryGrowthStoryFP/MavenStory2
<br>ii.) A graph of product synergy: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/ProductSynergy/ProductSynergy?publish=yes
<br>iii.)Example of cross-channel bid optimization and channel portfolio analyses conducted to achieve the above growth: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/MySQLTableauMavenFuzzyFactoryProject59/Cross-channelBidOptimization, https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/MySQLTableauMavenFuzzyFactoryProject54/ChannelPortfolios54,
<br>I've learned to do these analyses in John Pauler's highly recommended [course] (https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/)
<br>Class assignments for examples of other analyses. These are found in Other Projects and Assignments folder.  I have worked out all problems before looking at the suggested course solutions.  Some of my SQL analyses deviate from the approaches covered in the course but lead to the same final answers.

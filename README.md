This is the final project for Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence.  The goal is to relate Maven's growth story to potential investors.  I have supplemented the SQL analyses with a Tableau story and a chart (also found in Final Project Tableau Analysis.pdf)
<br>i.) Growth Story: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/MySQLTableauMavenFuzzyFactoryGrowthStoryFP/MavenStory2
<br>ii.) A graph of product synergy: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/ProductSynergy/ProductSynergy?publish=yes
<br>iii.)Example of cross-channel bid optimization and channel portfolio analyses conducted to achieve the above growth: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/MySQLTableauMavenFuzzyFactoryProject59/Cross-channelBidOptimization, https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/MySQLTableauMavenFuzzyFactoryProject54/ChannelPortfolios54,
<br>I've learned to do these analyses in John Pauler's highly recommended [course] (https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/)
<br>Please also see the mid-course project on preparing data for an executive board meeting, as well as class assignments for examples of other analyses. These are found in Other Projects and Assignments folder.  I have worked out all problems before looking at the suggested course solutions.  Some of my SQL analyses deviate from the approaches covered in the course but lead to the same final answers.

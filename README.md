The projects and exercises here are done from the perspective of a data analyst at an early-stage eCommerce startup.  The analyst works with the marketing team to analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.  

<br/>The analyst first helps the company prepare data for an executive board meeting (see the materials for the midterm project). Findings:
- Strong growth in sessions, orders, and conversion rates (Q1 analysis)
- Strong growth in brand orders (orders placed after explicitly searching for Maven in the browser, Q2 analysis) 
- Relative increase in desktop VS mobile orders (Q3 analysis) 
- Strong growth in organic search and direct type in sessions (Q4 analysis), indicating an increase in sessions that are of no cost to the company
- Increase in conversion rates from around 3.2% to 4.4% in under a year (Q5 analysis)
- 0.8% lift from the new landing page, leading to extra 50 orders per month on average (Q6 analysis)
- Lift of $8.51 per billing page view ($10,160/month) due to the new billing page (Q8 analysis)
- Additional analyses: Conversion funnel analyses for the new landing page (Q7 analyses)



<br/>Later, the analyst relates Maven's growth story to potential investors (see the final project).  I have supplemented these analyses with a Tableau story and a chart (also found in Final Project Tableau Analysis.pdf)
The growth story can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitriy.popov.velasco/viz/MySQLTableauMavenFuzzyFactoryGrowthStoryFP/MavenStory2) .


<br>The projects are part of John Pauler's highly recommended Advanced SQL: [MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/). See class assignments for examples of other analyses, which are found in *Other Projects and Assignments folder*.  I have worked out all problems before looking at the suggested course solutions, and while some of my  analyses deviate from the approaches covered in the course, they lead to the same final answers.
